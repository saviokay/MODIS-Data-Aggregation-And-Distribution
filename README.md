Efficient &amp; Flexible Aggregation, Distribution of MODIS Atmospheric Products based on Climate Analytics-as-a- Service Framework

Remote sensing products of atmospheric clouds and aerosols from MODIS are one of the most widely used data sets for study Earth-Atmosphere systems. Support is requested to refactor the current MODIS atmosphere Level-3 product aggregation and distribution system to drastically reduce data generation and processing time, and to facilitate user-defined customization, using the framework of Advanced Data Analytics Platform (ADAPT) and Data Analytics and Storage System (DASS) provided by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS).
